# Witnessing a dream's beginning, something I've never heard anyone else discuss, something that occured to me one day.

Some time ago, I remember I had been awake for well over twenty hours, I was exhausted. I recall laying down in bed, closing my eyes and after a short period of time I could physically feel myself falling unconcious - my body began to feel numb, and this was a familiar feeling for me where I would usually be moments away from entering a state of sleep paralysis. My eyes were closed, and I realized I couldn't move or open my eyes, was I having a sleep paralysis? I was aware that this was happening, but then in the darkness I started to hear very loud, but beautiful music. I remember focusing, because I wanted to try and remember what it sounded like when I woke up - but then, I noticed almost neon like grass forming "beneath" me, and noticed trees beginning to appear in this black void I was in. The moment this happened, I felt overwhelmed because I was lucid during the entire ordeal, and instantly began wondering to myself if I was witnessing the beginning of a dream while I was lucid. The audio came first in the sound of beautiful instrumentals, before the almost neon like trees and grass begam to appear - is this how our dreams begin, do they start off in a black void that we are unaware in as a sort of placement setting until the dream "begins" ? This is something that I've thought about ever since it happened, but I can't find anyone or anything online about this having occurred to anyone else. What was this, and how is it possible? I want to understand more about dreams and the space that shouldn't exist when we are asleep.
