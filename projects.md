Something I have been working on for some time now though there are times I sometimes go weeks without touching it. The story I have in mind for it is all over the place, something I need to work on and settle on something conrete though this is a fun way to begin learning a new language I'm fond of, Python. This is nothing more than a passion project, though it's also a piece of media that may be considered volitile or degemerate to most as it will be a form of vent piece. The art for the menu was done for a friend of mine but isn't completed, and the menu will be animated at some point. There isn't much more information for me to give, besides stating that I have something playable and I'm happy with the results I've made despite the mess of a story that needs to be touched on.

## VN related Notes for myself - Things to work on next.

- story and script.
- animated eye movement.
- animated main menu

- continue to use virtuoso to create more OST for the overall setting.
- lining up audio sound effects with text on the screen, pausing / ending the audio when skipped.
